<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Worm Gearbox Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-enveloping Worm Gearbox</li><li>Single-envelop Worm Gearbox</li><li>Double-envelop Worm Gearbox</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The worm gearbox market includes three main types: non-enveloping, single-enveloping, and double-enveloping worm gearboxes. Non-enveloping worm gearboxes feature a simpler design with less friction, making them suitable for light-duty applications. Single-enveloping gearboxes offer enhanced efficiency and torque due to the wrapping of the worm around the wheel, ideal for medium-duty tasks. Double-enveloping gearboxes provide the highest load capacity and torque, thanks to a more complex design that fully encases the worm, catering to heavy-duty industrial applications.</p></p>
