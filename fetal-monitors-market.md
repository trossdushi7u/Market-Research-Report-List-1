<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fetal Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fetal monitors market comprises two primary types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive fetal monitors involve direct contact with the fetus, typically through internal devices like scalp electrodes that provide precise data on fetal heart rates. Conversely, non-invasive fetal monitors, such as external Doppler devices, measure heart rates and contractions without penetrating the skin, making them safer and more comfortable for the mother and fetus. Both types serve critical roles in monitoring fetal health during pregnancy and labor.</p></p>
