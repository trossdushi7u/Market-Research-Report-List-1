<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRP (Fiber-Reinforced Plastic) Grating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Molded Grating</li><li>Pultruded Grating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Fiber-Reinforced Plastic (FRP) grating market comprises two primary types: molded grating and pultruded grating. Molded grating is produced by a process that involves compressing fiberglass resin into a mold, resulting in a strong, lightweight product with a non-skid surface ideal for walkways and platforms. Pultruded grating, on the other hand, is created by pulling fiberglass strands through a resin bath and forming them into long sections, offering a rigid structure suited for heavy loads and corrosive environments. Both types are valued for their durability and resistance to environmental factors.</p></p>
